The function takes two parameters: - `_role`: The bytes32 identifier of the role to be renounced. - `_account`: The address of the account renouncing the role. To ensure security and prevent   unintended renunciations, the function checks that `_account` is the same as `_msgSender()`. Before allowing the role to be renounced, the function performs the following check: - Verifies that the `_account` address is not the zero address (`address(0)`) to prevent   accidental modifications of the zero address, which may have special significance.

The function performs the following operations: - It checks if the sender (`_from`) is whitelisted using the `mproRoleManager.isWhitelisted`   function. If the sender is whitelisted, the function returns 0, indicating no burn is applied. - If the sender is not whitelisted, the function calculates the burn amount by applying the   burn rate to the transaction amount (`_amount`). The burn rate is represented as a percentage   scaled by a factor of 10000 (e.g., a burn rate of 10% is represented as 1000). The calculated   burn amount is then returned.

This external function allows an account with the OWNER_ROLE to set the burn rate, which is the percentage of the tokens that will be burned during certain operations. The burn rate is expressed as a percentage with a precision of up to three decimal places. For example, a burn rate of 1000 represents a 10% burn rate (1000 / 100 = 10%). A constraint is enforced to ensure that the burn rate does not exceed 10% (represented as 1000 in the contract). This safeguard prevents setting an excessively high burn rate that could adversely impact the token economy or operations of the contract. It's critical to input the correct value for the burn rate as it directly affects the token dynamics. Only authorized accounts with the OWNER_ROLE can perform this operation, ensuring that the burn rate is controlled and updated responsibly.",

It checks whether any of the involved parties in a token transfer (the sender, receiver, and the caller of the function) are on a blocklist. If any of these addresses are blocklisted, the function reverts the transaction, preventing the transfer. Being a `view` function, it does not modify the state of the blockchain but reads from it. This function can be integrated into the token transfer process to add an additional layer of security and compliance, ensuring that tokens cannot be transferred by or to blocklisted addresses.",

This function allows an address with the `LISTER_ROLE` to either whitelist or remove an account from the contract's whitelist.

The function takes two parameters: - `_account`: The address to be either whitelisted or removed from the whitelist. - `_whitelist`: A boolean indicating whether to whitelist (`true`) or unwhitelist (`false`)   the account. The function sets the whitelisting status of the specified account by updating the `whitelisted` mapping accordingly.
