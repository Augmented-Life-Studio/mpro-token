The function performs the following operations: - It checks if the sender (`_from`) is whitelisted using the `mproRoleManager.isWhitelisted`   function. If the sender is whitelisted, the function returns 0, indicating no burn is applied. - If the sender is not whitelisted, the function calculates the burn amount by applying the   burn rate to the transaction amount (`_amount`). The burn rate is represented as a percentage   scaled by a factor of 10000 (e.g., a burn rate of 10% is represented as 1000). The calculated   burn amount is then returned.

        "details": "Public function to revoke a specific role from an account. This function allows the contract owner to remove a previously granted role from the `_account` address. Roles are crucial for defining permissions and responsibilities within the contract, and revoking a role removes those associated privileges from the specified account. The function takes two parameters: - `_role`: The bytes32 identifier of the role to be revoked. - `_account`: The address from which the role is to be removed. Before revoking the role, the function performs the following checks: - Verifies that the `_account` address is not the zero address (`address(0)`) to prevent accidental   modifications of the zero address, which may have special significance. - Ensures that the `_account` currently has the role to be revoked, providing a safeguard against   unnecessary or mistaken revocations. Access to this function is restricted to addresses with the `OWNER_ROLE`, ensuring that only contract owners or administrators can revoke roles. Upon successful revocation of the role, the function updates the `assignedRoles` mapping and calls the internal `_revokeRole` function.",

        "details": "Sets the burn rate for the contract. This external function allows an account with the OWNER_ROLE to set the burn rate, which is the percentage of the tokens that will be burned during certain operations. The burn rate is expressed as a percentage with a precision of up to three decimal places. For example, a burn rate of 1000 represents a 10% burn rate (1000 / 100 = 10%). A constraint is enforced to ensure that the burn rate does not exceed 10% (represented as 1000 in the contract). This safeguard prevents setting an excessively high burn rate that could adversely impact the token economy or operations of the contract. It's critical to input the correct value for the burn rate as it directly affects the token dynamics. Only authorized accounts with the OWNER_ROLE can perform this operation, ensuring that the burn rate is controlled and updated responsibly.",
        "params": {
          "_burnRate": "The new burn rate to be set, scaled by a factor of 100. For example, to set a                 burn rate of 1%, `_burnFee` should be 10."

It checks whether any of the involved parties in a token transfer (the sender, receiver, and the caller of the function) are on a blocklist. If any of these addresses are blocklisted, the function reverts the transaction, preventing the transfer. Being a `view` function, it does not modify the state of the blockchain but reads from it. This function can be integrated into the token transfer process to add an additional layer of security and compliance, ensuring that tokens cannot be transferred by or to blocklisted addresses.",

This function allows an address with the `LISTER_ROLE` to either whitelist or remove an account from the contract's whitelist. Whitelisting typically grants certain privileges or exemptions to the whitelisted account, while removing an account from the whitelist revokes these privileges. The function takes two parameters: - `_account`: The address to be either whitelisted or removed from the whitelist. - `_whitelist`: A boolean indicating whether to whitelist (`true`) or unwhitelist (`false`)   the account. The function sets the whitelisting status of the specified account by updating the `whitelisted` mapping accordingly.
