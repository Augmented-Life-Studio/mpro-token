The function performs the following checks and operations: - It ensures that the length of the `_to` address array matches the length of the `_amount` array,   ensuring each address has a corresponding amount to be distributed. - It then iterates over these arrays, calling the `distribute` function for each address-amount pair.   The `distribute` function is responsible for the actual minting and transferring of tokens,   as well as performing necessary checks such as ensuring the distribution period has started and   that the total distributed amount does not exceed the available quantity.

The function performs the following operations: - It checks if the sender (`_from`) is whitelisted using the `mproRoleManager.isWhitelisted`   function. If the sender is whitelisted, the function returns 0, indicating no burn is applied. - If the sender is not whitelisted, the function calculates the burn amount by applying the   burn rate to the transaction amount (`_amount`). The burn rate is represented as a percentage   scaled by a factor of 10000 (e.g., a burn rate of 10% is represented as 1000). The calculated   burn amount is then returned.

If the sender is whitelisted, the function returns 0, indicating no burn is applied. - If the sender is not whitelisted, the function calculates the burn amount by applying the   burn rate to the transaction amount (`_amount`).
